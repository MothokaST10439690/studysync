# StudySync

StudySync is a responsive PHP and MySQL collaboration platform for student groups. It combines group workspaces, task tracking, a calendar, file sharing, chat, member profiles, invitations, password recovery, notifications, admin tools, and progressive-web-app support.

## Current feature set

- Public and private study groups with join-request moderation
- Group tasks, due dates, status tracking, and calendar views
- Shared file library with authenticated downloads
- Group chat with a `+` attachment control for pictures and documents
- A chat file panel that keeps recent shared resources within reach
- Seven-day group invitations by email address and shareable link
- Student profile pages with photo, institution, course, bio, and activity statistics
- One-time password-reset tokens that expire after 60 minutes
- In-app notifications for invitations and group membership events
- Safe automatic page refreshes that pause while forms or uploads are in progress
- Responsive desktop/mobile navigation and installable PWA metadata
- Admin dashboard for platform-level oversight

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or newer with PDO MySQL and `mbstring`
- MySQL 8 or MariaDB 10.4+
- A web server whose document root is the `public` directory
- Write permission for `public/uploads`

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `MYSQLHOST` | Yes | MySQL host name |
| `MYSQLPORT` | Yes | MySQL port |
| `MYSQLDATABASE` | Yes | Database name |
| `MYSQLUSER` | Yes | Database user |
| `MYSQLPASSWORD` | Yes | Database password |
| `APP_URL` | Recommended | Public base URL used in password-reset links |
| `APP_ENV` | Recommended | Set to `production` in production |
| `MAIL_FROM` | For email reset delivery | Sender address used by PHP `mail()` |

## Database setup

For a new installation, create the database and import:

```text
public/database/init.sql
```

For an existing StudySync database, back it up and run this migration once:

```text
public/database/2026_06_29_collaboration_features.sql
```

The migration adds chat-file relationships, group invitations, notifications, password-reset tokens, and profile fields.

## Local start

1. Configure the environment variables above.
2. Make `public` the web document root.
3. Ensure `public/uploads` is writable by PHP.
4. Import the correct SQL file for a fresh or existing database.
5. Start the PHP/web-server process of your choice.

The repository includes Railway/Nixpacks configuration that serves `/app/public`.

## New collaboration workflows

### Chat attachments

Open a group, choose **Chat**, select the round `+` button, choose a supported file, and send. The message shows an image preview when appropriate and always includes an authenticated download action. Recent files also appear in the **Chat files** panel.

Supported types: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT, CSV, ZIP, PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, and WebP. The limit is 100 MB per group file.

### Group invitations

Group creators and administrators can open **Members → Invite people**, enter an email address, and create a link valid for seven days. Registered users receive an in-app notification. For an unregistered person, copy and send the generated link directly.

### Password recovery

The sign-in page links to **Forgot password?**. Reset tokens are random, stored only as SHA-256 hashes, expire after 60 minutes, and become invalid after one successful use. Configure `APP_URL`, `MAIL_FROM`, and a working PHP mail transport for production email delivery.

## Security notes

- New account, profile, invite, notification, chat attachment, file, and recovery actions use CSRF tokens.
- Downloads verify that the requester belongs to the file's group.
- Uploads use random stored names, extension allowlists, size limits, and image validation.
- Group management actions are limited to group creators or administrators.
- Password-reset responses do not reveal whether an email address exists.
- New registrations always receive the student role; administrator access must be granted deliberately in the database or through a future secured admin workflow.

## Production considerations

Railway's local filesystem can be ephemeral. Use a persistent volume or object storage before relying on uploaded files in production. Configure a transactional email provider or SMTP bridge for dependable reset-email delivery. Back up the database before applying migrations.

## Verification

All PHP files pass PHP 8.2 syntax lint. Before release, run the acceptance checklist in `docs/StudySync_Project_Documentation.docx` against a staging database and verify desktop and mobile layouts.
